> For my dad's 62th birthday I gifted him a title page to a manuscript called "Dear Dad" with 95 little letters. This is the first release.

#### Repo
- The main product is: https://kimonwater.github.io/LieberPapa/
- Going back to the beginnings of the world wide web when it was simply about sharing html files

#### Roadmap
- finish content (89 letters, attachment with the 2 "about dad" and "a random forest of a family tree" sections)
- manage automatically
- display prettier
- translate function

 *Many blessings 🙏🏽🖤*
